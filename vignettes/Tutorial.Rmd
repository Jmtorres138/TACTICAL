This is a tutorial for the R package TACTICAL ("Tissue of ACTion scores for Investigating Complex trait Associations at Loci"). 


## Setting up 

```{r setup}

library("TACTICAL")

```

## Input files 

## Step 1: Annotating GWAS associations or fine-mapped bayesian credible sets 

Pass

```{r step1}

```


## Step 2: Calculating tissue score vectors for each SNP 

Pass

```{r step2}

```


## Step 3: Calculating tissue of action (TOA) scores for each genetic signal (i.e. independent GWAS association or credible set)

Pass

```{r step3}

```


## Step 4 (Optional): Apply a rule-based classier to assign signals to tissue and/or cell types 

Pass


```{r step4}

```
